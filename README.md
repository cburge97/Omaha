# Omaha 
## Description
### What?

Omaha  is a web application that will help users. It will allow users to see different statistics about different players. It will also give them strategies and helpful advice to build a Fantasy Football Team.
### Why?

With Omaha , we aim to assist people who have had trouble building a Fantasy Football team in the past. This app could be used for daily fantasy football player, weekly, or league fantasy football. If our program works correctly, it would give them an advantage over their competition and the potential to win their league. There are other apps that do similar things to ours but most of them are not extremely accurate at predicting the stats for all the players.
### How?

Omaha  will purely be a software product that runs on a web application. The app will be able to store data from the past seasons then recover the data efficiently. Our team will implement a full-stack application model, with front end and back end. The framework and tools we expect to use are:

Front End
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript

Back end
* NodeJS
* Python
* SQL

Tools
*Anaconda (Jupyter Notebooks) Visual Studio Code, Git/GitHub
*Google Drive
*Kaggle.com
*Trello

Miscellaneous

## Deliverables

1.	Web app
  *View Player Stats
  **User can view different player stats. There will be a link the user clicks on and a pop up will showing the player stats
  *Import Current Team
  **User can import their current Fantasy Team and the app will show the user stats of their players and give them feedback
  *Offense Focused

  *Rate Trades
  **User will be able to put in a player they have and input a player they are trading for. The app will give them feedback on the trade, show them the risks, and grade the trade on a letter grade
  *Rate Add/Drop
  **User will be able to put a player that they are either dropping from their team, a player they wish to add, or both. The app will give them feedback based on what action they do. (Similar to Rate Trades)
